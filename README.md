# PokeRasa
Implementation of the Pokemon battle engine in Unity, with a few overworld functions as well.


# Features
- Comprehensive Pokémon data structures, with plans to include all released Pokémon
- Functional battle system, with plans to include all moves, abilities and regional gimmicks (Megas, Z-moves, etc.)
- Accessible animation system based on IEnumerators

# How To
- Create a new project with Unity, then import everything in the Assets folder. The Battle scene, which handles single battles, is included as of now (08/24/23), but in the long run other battle modes will be added.
