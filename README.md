# PokeRasa
Implementation of the Pokemon battle engine in Unity, with a few overworld functions planned as well.


# Features
- Comprehensive Pokémon data structures, with plans to include all released Pokémon
- Functional battle system, with plans to include all moves, abilities and regional gimmicks (Megas, Z-moves, etc.)
- Accessible animation system based on IEnumerators

# Progress
- All moves and Pokémon up to Gen 3 are fully implemented.
- The MapMaker scene includes a map editor with saving and loading functionality.

# How To
- Create a new project with Unity, then import everything in the Assets folder. The Battle scene, which handles single battles, is included as of now (08/24/23), but in the long run other battle modes will be added.

# Credits and Attributions
- Many of the assets used in this game base are taken from Pokémon games, including all map tiles, all sprites up to Generation 3, all cries, many battle animation sprites, and all sound effects. In addition, Pokémon sprites after Gen 3 and some battle sprites were taken from pokeemerald-expansion by the Rom Hacking Hideout.
